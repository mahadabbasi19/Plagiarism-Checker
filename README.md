### About the Plagiarism Checker
The Plagiarism Checker is a Python script designed to compare the text content of two documents and calculate a similarity percentage. It uses the RapidFuzz library to perform text comparison based on fuzzy matching. A high similarity percentage indicates potential plagiarism.

### Getting Started
To use the Plagiarism Checker, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your computer.

Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install python-docx PyPDF2 rapidfuzz

Run the plagiarism_checker.py script.

### Supported File Formats
The Plagiarism Checker supports the following file formats:

Text files (.txt): You can compare two plain text files for plagiarism.

Word documents (.docx): The script can analyze the content of DOCX files.

PDF files (.pdf): PDF files are also supported. The script extracts text from PDFs for comparison.

### Usage
To use the Plagiarism Checker, provide the names of the two files you want to compare, separated by a comma when prompted.
For example:

Enter Names of Two Files (Comma Separated): file1.txt, file2.txt

The script will then analyze the content of the specified files and provide a similarity percentage along with a plagiarism alert if the similarity is above a certain threshold (default is 70%).

### Plagiarism Detection
The Plagiarism Checker calculates a similarity ratio using the RapidFuzz library. If the similarity ratio is equal to or greater than 70%, a plagiarism alert is displayed. You can adjust this threshold in the code if needed.
